Language-agnostic Git template repository to kickstart your projects!

## How to use this template

### Create a new repository from the template

To use this template for your new project, click **"Use this template"** near the top of the page, and select a name for your repository to create it in your own account or organization.

![](./docs/images/github-create-repo-from-template.gif)

### Clone your new repository locally

Once your new repository has been created, clone the repository to your local computer using the `git clone` command.

```
git clone https://github.com/<owner name>/<repository name>
```

### Configure pre-commit

This template is configured to run Git hooks using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), a "framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks." Linters and common checks are ran against your commits, catching errors and making sure your code is up to snuff before sharing it with the world!

After pre-commit is installed (consider using a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)), run the following command to configure the pre-commit hooks for your repository:

```
pre-commit install && pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

[The pre-commit hooks supplied with this project will cover most situations](https://github.com/ShahradR/git-template/pull/1), but you might wish to add more to the list depending on your requirements. Below are several examples of `.pre-commit-config.yaml` files used for different use cases—use this to tailor your hooks based on your project's needs!

<details>
<summary>Java</summary>

This version of the configuration file adds Java support by:

- Augmenting Prettier with [JHipster's Prettier plugin for Java](https://github.com/jhipster/prettier-java)
- Running [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) using the pre-commit hook provided by [gherynos/pre-commit-java](https://github.com/gherynos/pre-commit-java)
  - Checkstyle can also run as a plugin for Ant, Maven, or Gradle. Depending on your use case, you might want to run this check in your build automation tool instead

<details>
<summary>JavaScript/TypeScript</summary>

This version of the file introduces [pre-commit/mirrors-eslint](https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-eslint) to run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), a tool to "find and fix problems in your JavaScript code."

You'll need a valid ESLint configuration file to run this hook—see [Configuring ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) for details on how to set up your environment.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/359740.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/359740)

The pre-commit configuration has been adapted to lint both JavaScript and TypeScript code. The ESLint plugins required to run the hook must be listed under `additional_dependencies`—this particular example was taken from the [ShahradR/action-taskcat](https://github.com/ShahradR/action-taskcat) project, but you might need to customize the dependency list to fit your needs.

<summary>AWS CloudFormation templates</summary>

This version of the file adds the following pre-commit checks:

- [CloudFormation Linter](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-python-lint) to "validate CloudFormation yaml/json templates against the CloudFormation Resource Specification"
- [Stelligent cfn_nag](https://github.com/stelligent/cfn_nag) to "look for patterns in CloudFormation templates that may indicate insecure infrastructure"

#### CloudFormation Linter
